Goal:
Find all numbers in given ranges that equal a digit-pattern repeated t times.

Part 1:
t = 2 only.

Part 2:
t >= 2.

Definition:
Let k = number of digits in the base pattern s.
Let t = number of repeats.
Then the full number is:

    n = s * ((10^(k*t) − 1) / (10^k − 1))

s ranges from 10^(k−1) to 10^k − 1 (no leading zeros).

For each range [a, b]:
1. Choose k and t such that k*t <= max_digits_in_input.
2. Compute factor F = (10^(k*t) − 1) / (10^k − 1).
3. Solve for s so that a <= s*F <= b.
   This gives an interval:
        ceil(a/F) <= s <= floor(b/F)
   intersected with valid s-range.
4. Every such s generates exactly one repeated-number n.

Sum all generated n for each part.
