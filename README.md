# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2025, implemented in `Rust 1.91` with `2024` edition syntax and features.

Each day lives in its own directory, and every puzzle includes:

- `topic.txt` — the puzzle description
- `solution.md` — the written explanation of the algorithm
- `solution/` — a fully standalone Rust crate containing main.rs
- `input.txt` — my personal puzzle input
- `output_part_one.txt` — computed answer for Part 1
- `output_part_two.txt` — computed answer for Part 2

## How to run

```shell
cd "1../solution"
cargo run
```
